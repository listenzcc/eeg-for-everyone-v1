Motion imaging (MI) BCI, also known as electroencephalography (EEG)-based motion imaging, is a brain-computer interface (BCI) technology that enables individuals to control external devices or computer applications using brain signals associated with motor imagery. This technology translates the user's mental commands into specific actions or movements, providing a direct communication pathway between the brain and external devices.
